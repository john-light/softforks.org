Want to add new content to softforks.org? There are only two rules:

1. It must be relevant to an active bitcoin soft fork proposal.
2. It should only **add** content, it should not **delete** content. Some exceptions may be made for editing or if the factual accuracy of existing content is in question. Feel free to create an issue to discuss.

Feel free to add or remove anything below that you do or do not need. If you want to add content for more than one soft fork or use case, please open a different issue for each so they can be evaluated independently.

## New soft fork content

Add any new content for a soft fork proposal, either editing one of the existing pages or adding a new page for a soft fork that isn't listed yet. If you are adding a new soft fork that is not listed yet, the proposal must either have a BIP or at least an active champion if it is pre-BIP.

- Soft fork title: The title of the soft fork  
- URL: The URL of a website that is representative of the soft fork  
- BIP: The BIP number, if it has one, and a link to the BIP or draft BIP  
- Date: The date on the BIP (leave blank if there is no BIP)  
- Author(s): The name(s) of the author(s) of the proposal  
- Status: The status of the BIP. If there is no BIP, put "Draft".  
- Keywords: New opcodes or other relevant features / bug fixes that are part of the proposal and may be present in other proposals as well  
- Miscellaneous notes: Use this field for any other miscellaneous information about the given soft fork that you believe is relevant for everyone to know e.g. proposed activation parameters, comparisons with other soft forks, etc.
